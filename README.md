# The BigBasic Programming Language

Inspired by Small Basic, BigBasic is children-oriented,  simple enough but incorporates more features 

# Getting Started

# A Quick Tour 

Naming 

We are looking for more interesting name ideas buds

# Type Definitions

We offer basic types:

Text = str

Number = (int, float)

List = list

# Tokens

# Pattern matching

# Nested Structs

## Example 

Example code

<pre lang="markdown"><code>'''plaintext
thing Position
	arg x 
	arg y 
end 

thing Sleep 
	arg name 
	arg pos 
end 

pos = new Position [100,200]
s = new Sleep["Bed",pos]

print t.pos.x  ^^ Output: 100
'''</code></pre>


# Arrays are one-based

# Lazy evaluation
